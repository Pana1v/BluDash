This app allows you to control your arduino over bluetooth, This offers more features such as voice control, customisable commands, 3 Sliders and Additional Buttons for more operations. Moreover you can also view your terminal output at the same time. Drive Power for adjust steering sensitivity. Also includes 2 dedicated buttons for rotating
It's very easy to configure, it sends phrases and texts for every operation to your Arduino.

The code fed into our Robocon robots helps it interface with the app in real time, choose from a variety of modes and initiate an auto-lock sequence so that the robot can 
take down targets with precision, these parameters can be altered precisely in real time.
While other teams use PS2 controllers, this app gives us the flexibilty to make better,faster control system, 
far more advanced than one you would get from an off the shelf controller .
